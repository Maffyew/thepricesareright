					<header><h2>Our Story</h2></header>
					<p> Karl and Lisa first met in College at a party. They both were independently worried
						 that the other one would not get in touch after the party was over, but lo and behold 
						 they kept in touch and almost immediately fell head over heels in love. Their relationship 
						 continued through College, even enduring a period of long distance after Lisa graduated early. 
						 However, love prevailed, and they were reunited in Virginia and have been living together ever since. &hellip;</p>

					<header><h2>The Proposal</h2></header>
					<p style="font-size:85%"> Karl and Lisa had been dating for quite some time, and an engagement seemed
						 to be inevitable. In fact, Karl had already talked to his mother and gotten a ring that had been 
						 in his family for multiple generations to give to Lisa for the engagement. However, due to Karl's snooping he had found out 
						 that Lisa was a different ring size, and was planning to get a ring custom-made for the proposal. 
						 Fast forward to a trip Lisa and Karl took to a Jeweller, where Lisa happened to try out various rings she was interested in. 
						 They turned out to be too big, as Lisa was two ring sizes smaller than she had realized. Karl took the ring passed down in his family 
						 and slipped it onto her finger and it turned out to fit perfectly, in the ultimate Cinderella moment. They got engaged shortly after.</p>
